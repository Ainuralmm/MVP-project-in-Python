## 🚀 Intelligent Course Management Automation (MVP)

### Project Overview
This project implements an Intelligent Automation Solution designed to drastically increase efficiency by eliminating manual data entry (Data Entry) for Course Management activities within the Oracle system.

The core objective is to reduce manual, low-value work for operational teams (like Matteo and Angela) and transition toward a future where data input is handled via natural language processing (NLP).

### Current Solution Status (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
The current version (MVP) provides a robust, functional application based on a modular architecture.

### Key Features Implemented
The automation sequences for the following critical course management phases are fully coded and functional:

- Course Creation

- Edition Creation

- Activity Creation

- Student Enrollment (Allievi)

### User Interface (UI)

Technology: The user interface is built using Streamlit, serving as a simple, single-page dashboard.

Value: The UI acts as a crucial "bridge" that allows non-technical users to input data quickly and interact with the complex Oracle automation code without needing to navigate multiple Oracle screens.

### Efficiency Gains (Quantified)

The application significantly streamlines the workflow and reduces the cognitive load of data entry.

### Technical Architecture
The project is built for scalability and maintainability using a structured design pattern.

Architecture Pattern: MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
- We adopted the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture to organize the codebase.

- Benefit: As the automation code grows in complexity, the MVP pattern prevents the code from becoming convoluted, ensuring future development, modifications, and debugging remain simple, fast, and error-free.

## 🎯 Strategic Roadmap: The Future with AI (Vision 2.0)
The final goal of this project is to integrate advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities to achieve true intelligent automation.

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Goal: To allow users to interact with the system using simple, unstructured language (like a text message) instead of filling out structured forms.

Example Future Command: "Create the edition 'Excel for Everyone' in the existing course 'Excel,' starting November 5th for a duration of 2 days."

Impact: The AI will interpret the text and automatically insert all required data fields into Oracle, drastically reducing working time.

2. Intelligent Excel Data Integration
Goal: Use NLP techniques to automatically read unstructured data from Excel files (currently used for edition planning, attendance tracking, and student assignment).

Impact: This eliminates manual data entry for complex, bulk activities, such as assigning students to large editions and registering course attendance/absence records.
